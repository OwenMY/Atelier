### Product Overview

The product overview section has two main parts. The main image display, and the product information. These two main components are seperated into four sub components in an attempt to maximize file size. The overview section has many pieces of functionality. The main elements to highlight are as follows:

  -The Product information which is rendered onto the page dynamically based on the current product and the selected style. The average rating is shown here with a link next to it which on click will scroll to the ratings and reviews section.

  -The style selector dynamically renderes product styles in rows of four. There is no limit to the styles a product can have.

  -The main image display always shows the first image for the product and the selcected style
